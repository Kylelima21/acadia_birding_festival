Saddleback Mountain for Bicknell's Thrush,"2-3 miles of difficult hiking down steep ski slopes (no switchback path, with 2000 ft drop). Only for those in very good physical walking shape. The group will ride up the mountain in ATVs, but descent will be by foot.","This is a day trip at Saddleback Mountain. Bicknell's Thrush unique breeding ecology above 3000 feet requires a steady climb to the barren, bald peaks of Saddleback Mountain tucked away in the western mountains of Maine. Note that the trip leaders do their best to locate this special thrush, and generally find one or more, but there are no guarantees. Many northern specialty birds will be found among the rocky summit heaths and boreal krummholz ecosystems of the Rangeley Lakes region, offering opportunities for a variety of hard-to-find boreal species like Canada Jay, Boreal Chickadee, Spruce Grouse, and Black-backed Woodpecker. We will study bird communication and ecology of the spruce-fir forest and dwarf shrub summits where Nashville and Blackpoll Warblers, Swainson's Thrush and Blue-headed Vireo are calling from the spruce zone. Participants should bring snacks, lunch, beverages, bug repellent and sunscreen and dress in layers as it could be cold. Saddleback Mountain is 3.5 hours from the festival center, so we recommend you find a motel closer to the mountain the night before the trip. There are several lodging oportunities in Rangeley, only 15 minutes from the mountain. Meet at the Saddleback Mountain Ski Resort (GPS coordinates: 44.946038, -70.528111)."
Pelagic Seabird Boat Trip,Hours of standing on a fast moving large catamaran boat.,"Our popular pelagic seabird boat trip provides a unique opportunity to see birds that live and thrive on the open ocean, far from shore-bound eyes. Each trip is different, offering the potential for Atlantic Puffin, Common Murre, Razorbill, Phalaropes, Shearwaters, Northern Gannet, Jaegers, Storm-Petrels, Terns, and maybe a few surprises. We sail aboard the Friendship V, one of the fastest most stable birding platforms in the country. Depending on conditions, and recent reports, we may visit Mt Desert Rock (25 miles off-shore), the nearby ""Ball Park"", a nutrient rich upwelling, and Petit Manan Island for nesting birds, all known hotspots. Good birds are often seen along the way. Experienced local ABF birding guides and a ship naturalist will assist in locating and directing you to target birds. Although birding is our primary focus, incidental sightings of marine mammals are possible. We sometimes see whales, porpoise, dolphins and seals. If you wish to experience the rich diversity of bird life on the open North Atlantic Ocean and its coastal islands, this trip is for you. Bring your ID! For comfort, dress for winter. There are hot and cold beverages and snacks for purchase on the boat. If cancelled due to weather, the make-up date will be Monday from 11:40am-4:00pm on the regularly scheduled whale watch trip (if you can't make this date, we will refund your money).

Pretty Marsh and Long Pond Fire Road,"2-3 miles of easy to moderate terrain, with 100 ft elevation change, and some rocky paths.","Surrounded by a maturing red spruce forest with views of Hardwood and Bartlett Islands, Pretty Marsh is an Acadia gem where land meets sea. Blackburnian Warbler, Northern Parula, White-winged Crossbill, Golden-crowned Kinglet, Red-breasted Nuthatch, Blue-headed Vireo, and Hermit Thrush make this seaside forest their home. Bald Eagle, Osprey, Common Loon, Red-breasted Merganser, and occasionally, non-breeding Long-tailed Ducks and White-winged Scoters as well as Harbor Seal are seen in the saltwater of Blue Hill Bay. Though called Pretty Marsh, the picnic area where we walk is not a marsh. Meet at the entrance to the Pretty Marsh picnic area (GPS coordinates: 44.332233, -68.403490)."
Schoodic Peninsula,"2 miles of easy to moderate walking, and a few hours in the van.","Though part of Acadia National Park, this gem lies across the bay from Bar Harbor on the mainland. Archeological collections from the Schoodic Peninsula reveal evidence of Great Auk and Sea Mink which attest the areas past wild and remote status. Recent land acquisitions have expanded the national park's jurisdiction assuring preservation and better access to a larger contiguous landscape and a developing corridor for wildlife passage and refugia, Schoodic Point to Schoodic Mountain. This field trip visits these more remote areas of Acadia National Park, stopping at peninsula hotspots in pursuit of migrants, searching for local Spruce Grouse, and scoping birds out over the ocean. Lunch is included. VAN TRIP - Meet at the Acadia Repertory Theater in Somesville (GPS coordinates: 44.358080 -68.337213)."
Rockefeller Carriage Road,2-3 miles of easy terrain.,"This walk starts at the Eagle Lake parking lot. From the parking lot we take the Rockefeller Carriage Road toward the Witch Hole Loop Trail. Along the way we'll walk through a mixed forest burned by the Fire of 1947. This forest is home to Black-throated Blue and Magnolia Warbler, Common Yellowthroat, Ovenbird, Northern Waterthrush, Alder Flycatcher, and Ruffed Grouse. Multiple wetlands provide habitat for occasional-to-rare sightings of American Bittern, Common Mergansers and Pied-billed Grebe, as well as sandpipers and waders. Some lingering ducks in the spring can help make this an excellent place to bird during the Acadia Birding Festival. Various frogs and turtles to be seen and heard too! Meet at Eagle Lake parking area (GPS coordinates: 44.377970, -68.252488)."
Ship Harbor Nature Trail,"1.2 miles, moderate walk with some roots and rocks in trail.","This is one of the island's most beautiful spots. Ship Harbor is a small, nearly landlocked harbor, connected to the open ocean by a narrow gut. The trail begins in a small field featuring edge habitat, quickly yielding to red and white spruce forest that generally shadows the shoreline of Ship Harbor and its connecting waters to the sea. At mid-point, a short side trip down to a round rock beach, at the head of the harbor, is well worth the time to experience a pristine pool of salt water warmly embraced by a boreal forest. Traversing the spruce-fir forest you will be greeted by Golden-crowned Kinglet, Red-breasted Nuthatch, Black-capped Chickadees as well as Dark-eyed Junco, and White-throated and Song Sparrow. Downy, Hairy, and Pileated Woodpeckers make their homes here and there is a good chance that you'll hear the erratically musical trill of a Winter Wren from deep within a tangle of slash, nearby. At its apogee, the trail emerges onto pink granite ledges, fronting the open Atlantic Ocean where a brief sea-watch will generally yield Common Eider, scoters, and Black Guillemot, diving for Rock Eel and Mussels. Common Loon, Red-necked Grebe, and Double-crested Cormorants are common in the water. The third leg, heading inland, places us in unusual open spaces somewhat reminiscent of Pine Barrens. Here we have encountered Merlin, in multiple years, and have witnessed a pair mating, no doubt nesting, in the area. Leaving the open spaces we once again enter the softwood forest, where Hermit Thrush forage in the litter, and American Redstart, Yellow, Nashville, Black and White, Yellow-rumped and Black-throated Green Warblers, Northern Parula, and Common Yellowthroat can be heard or seen. Meet at the Ship Harbor Trailhead parking lot (GPS coordinates: 44.231695, -68.325861)."
Clark Point Road,1.0 miles of easy walking.,"Clark Point Road is a little gem. The walking is easy and there are a variety of habitats ranging from open field, to hardwood forest, mixed growth, and conifers. The road creates edge habitat that offers great views of Chestnut-sided, Black-throated Green, Magnolia, Yellow-rumped, Black-and-white, and Yellow Warblers alongside Northern Parula, Common Yellowthroat, and American Redstart, and we often hear the drumming of Ruffed Grouse. Pileated, Hairy, and Downy Woodpeckers all grace the woods. Successional alder thickets yield Alder Flycatchers and the open fields along the road offer Eastern Bluebirds, and Song Sparrows. We will walk through private property with Red-eyed Vireo, Blue-headed Vireo, Purple Finche, Hermit Thrush, Brown Creeper, Red-breasted Nuthatch, Golden-crowned Kinglet, White-throated Sparrow and Winter Wren to access a secluded beach on the shore of Goose Cove where we may see Black Guillemot, Common Eider, Double Crested Cormorant, scoters, Osprey, and potentially the daily visit of the Bald Eagle. Meet at the corner of Clark Point Rd and Bradbury Lane in Bernard (Address: 1 Bradbury Lane, Bernard; GPS coordinates: 44.251587, -68.390760)."
Frenchboro Preserve on Long Island,5+ miles of easy to moderate trails and island roads. Be prepared to do lots of hiking.,"This exciting island trip starts at 7:45am at the Bass Harbor ferry dock where you will board the 8:00am ferry for Frenchboro on Long Island. The 45 min ride will give us a chance to search the waters of Blue Hill Bay for Black Guillemot, scoters, non-breeding Common Loon, Common Eider, Osprey, Bald Eagle and marine mammals. Once on the island the group will birdwatch their way through the village of Frenchboro itself and then along miles of trails through the diverse habitats of the Maine Coast Heritage Trust Frenchboro preserve. The day promises to be filled with over 50 species of birds as we search the island's maritime forests, riparian and wetland areas, ponds, shoreline and bold coastal cliffs and rocky headlands. In addition, the island offers great views of Mount Desert Island, its off-shore islands and the open ocean. There will also be plenty of time for exploration of the village around Lunt Harbor, with its history museum and other attractions. The ferry leaves Frenchboro at 2:00pm arriving back in Bass Harbor at 2:45pm. One of your leaders, Terry Towne, before retiring after 20 years in 2021, was the Maine Coast Heritage Trust Regional Steward for the Frenchboro Preserve and has an intimate knowledge of the island, its history, and its many natural features.

Park for free near Post Office at 209 Harbor Dr, Bass Harbor but arrive in time for the 0.3 mile walk to the ferry."
Blagden Preserve,"2 miles of fairly easy walking, with 150 ft descent to coast and back.","An excellent example of a maturing red spruce forest, the Blagden Preserve escaped the ravages of the devastating 1947 fire, thus maintaining its original character. We'll walk down a private paved road which offers open views to help us look for the much sought Blackburnian and Magnolia Warblers along with Black-throated Blue, Black-throated Green, Black and White, Pine, Yellow-rumped, and Chestnut-sided Warblers, Northern Parula, Common Yellowthroat, and Ovenbird. Blue-headed and Red-eyed Vireos are at home here as are Golden-crowned Kinglet, Brown Creeper and Red-breasted Nuthatch. Great-crested Flycatcher and Eastern Wood-Pewee are a long shot but possible, with occasional sightings of Purple Finch, Rose-breasted Grosbeak and Cedar Waxwings. There is a parallel path option, that is rocky and rooty, deep in the woods for those wanting more adventure. The trails converge near the shore where we pause for a rest and brief sea-watch, looking for Common and Red-throated Loon, Bald Eagle, Osprey, cormorants, scoters, gulls, and terns. Meet at The Nature Conservancy Blagden Preserve, 403 Indian Point Rd, Bar Harbor (GPS coordinates: 44.382747, -68.364876)."
Fish Ladders in Somesville,0.5 miles of easy walking.,"We will start out walking from the Acadia Repertory Theater down the main street of Somesville, the first town settled on MDI (in 1761) and listed as a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. We will watch the action around the Somes Mill Pond, site of the original saw mill on the island, now a real wildlife spectacle during the annual alewife (river herring) migration. The approximately ten inch long fish return each year to the head of Somes Sound on their way to spawn in Somes and Long Ponds. This migration and spawning effort is a real conservation success story with numbers rising from a few hundred returning alewife in 2005 to tens of thousands in more recent years thanks to restoration work on the fish passage ways coordinated by Somes-Meynell Wildlife Sanctuary and many partners. This migration attracts all kinds of predators including Bald Eagle, Osprey, cormorants, gulls, and seals engaged in the process of trying to grab at least one of the fish. This spring we are expecting a large cohort of alewife to make the journey back so it will be fun to see what happens! Eagles try to rob from osprey, harbor seals occasionally strafe the school of fish gathering at the base of the fish ladder at higher tides, and mergansers and cormorants try to dive for them in the mill pond. Great photo opportunities abound! From the mill pond we'll walk upstream into a beautiful cemetery with many large trees and a nice forested edge adjacent to the outflow of Somes Pond. We should find numerous warblers, vireos, and other songbirds along our route. Meet at the Acadia Repertory Theater in Somesville (GPS coordinates: 44.358080 -68.337213)."
Canoe and Bird at Northeast Creek,About 2 miles of canoeing.,"The Northeast Creek estuary dates back to the melting Wisconsian Glacier 13,000 years ago and is the largest freshwater outflow off the Mount Desert Range flowing north. Known locally as ""Fresh Meadow"" or ""King's Creek"", this tidal bog ecosystem has raised portions and tidal creeks which can be explored at your leisure while paddling these quiet waters. This trip will allow you an opportunity to become familiar with a variety of calls such as Common Yellow-throat and Black-throated Green Warblers, and Alder and Least Flycatchers. There is extensive edge habitat throughout the three mile paddle with diverse wetlands offering possible opportunities to observe the difficult-to-find American Bittern, Spotted Sandpipers, and Swamp, Savannah, and Song Sparrows. Northern Harrier sometimes nest in the upper reaches and can be occasionally seen gliding over the sedge marsh meadow seeking tidal mammals. Freshwater and tidal waterfowl utilize the variety of salinities found in this watershed, including Red-breasted Merganser, American Black Duck, and Mallard. Great Blue Heron, Greater and Lesser Yellowlegs, and Belted Kingfisher all search for feasts of fish and small invertebrates in the creek. Bald Eagle have nested at the mouth of this great estuary which provides a year round source of prey. Life vests, paddles and canoes are provided. Bring water, sunscreen, and snacks. Meet on Rt. 3 at bridge over Northeast Creek (GPS coordinates: 44.424796, -68.326904)."
Seal Cove along Cape Rd,2.5 miles of easy walking.,"This walk begins along the ocean's edge where we have opportunities to encounter lingering seaducks, plus eagles, loons and kingfishers. We will also monitor mixed habitat on the inland side as we walk along the shore. A little farther up Cape Road we turn inland and encounter shrubby habitat where we can hope to find warblers, flycatchers, sparrows, thrushes and others. One of the best parts of this walk is not only the abundance of species, but the ease of viewing many birds that stay low and close. The road is not heavily travelled, so we can expect to exercise our auditory acuity and help each other to re-learn our favorite bird songs. Meet at Seal Cove Picnic Area, 675 Cape Rd, Seal Cove (GPS coordinates: 44.283225, -68.409025)."
Sears Island,2-3 miles of easy terrain.,"Sears Island is connected to the mainland by a short, very birdable, causeway. The island is best known for its bird diversity and abundance during spring migration. It is also outstanding for the close-up observations of many of the bird species encountered. In short order, birds reveal themselves as a variety of habitats unfold - rocky shoreline, tidal flats, forest edges, old homestead clearings, towering oak and spruce trees, flowering and fruiting trees, vernal pools and wetlands. A wide, paved, abandoned roadway bisects the island and makes for an easy stroll for excellent bird observation and photography. The island's bird checklist is well over 200 species and over 85% of them have been documented during the months of May and June. Expect to see Osprey, Bald Eagle, Broad-winged Hawk, Common Raven, and Double-crested Cormorant overhead.
